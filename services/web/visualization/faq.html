    <li><b>Q: What is the difference between unsupervised and supervised machine learning?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Supervised machine learning involves user input on the dataset. The user says to the computer, "I have a
          pattern that I want you to understand. Here are some examples of that pattern." and the computer discovers
          the pattern involved as best it can.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unsupervised machine learning does not involve user input on the dataset. The user wants to discover patterns
          in the dataset at a scale or level of complexity that may not be easy for humans to perceive, but they do not
          tell the computer what those patterns are. Instead, the computer tells the user what patterns it discovers.
          The LDA topic modeling approach is an example of unsupervised machine learning.

    <li><b>Is there a requirement for the data types? Can I use your system to analyze tweets?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Absolutely! Keep in mind that longer documents tend to be easier to analyze for computers (and, often, humans),
          but analyzing tweets is quite doable for the models we have implemented here.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What is media framing?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In communication research, to frame is "to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more
          salient in a communicating text" (Entman, 1993, p. 52). Like any type of communication, news involves framing.
          Ideology of a society, ownership of a news organization, media routine, as well as individual media worker's
          preference all play some role, consciously or not, in shaping the news content (Shoemaker & Reese, 1996).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: How to conduct a framing analysis?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Communication researchers have developed a variety of approaches to analyze media framing. One popular
          quantitative approach is to first identify a list of frames and then manually classify news articles into
          one of the identified frames. Only a certain number of frames are common in the news coverage because one can
          frame an issue in multiple ways, but a frame must be shared on some level for it to be communicable and
          effective (Reese, 2001). Therefore, journalists often use <b>generic frames</b> in their reporting across a
          diverse range of issues, such as <i>human interest, conflict, attribution of responsibility, and economic
          consequences</i> (Neuman, Just, & Crigler, 1992; Nisbet, 2010; Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000). Regarding any
          particular issue, journalists also apply <b>issue-specific frames</b>. For example, science reporters often use
          benefit- and risk-driven frames to help their audience understand complicated scientific issues such as
          genetically modified organisms (Wang & Guo, 2018). The goal of framing analysis is to identify both
          generic and issue-specific frames.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: How long will it take to complete the analysis?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The larger your dataset, the more time it will need. Our current hardware requires a little longer than 30
          minutes to train on 1100 documents. Generally, the proportionality is linear(ie, you can double the time
          required for double the number of documents).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: Can I get access to your code?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Yes, you can find our codes on our <a href="https://github.com/davidatbu/openFraming/tree/master">Github page</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What if I want to make some changes to the topic modeling and/or the BERT algorithms?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may choose to customize some parameters through our web-based system (e.g., the number of the LDA topics).
          In order to further fine-tune the algorithms, you will need to have some programming experience
          and our codes can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/davidatbu/openFraming/tree/master">Github page</a>.

              We also provide four trained BERT-based classifiers on issues of gun violence, immigration, tobacco, and
              same-sex marriage. If you are also interested in one of these issues and you have relevant textual data,
              you can use our existing classifiers (<b>Step 5</b>) to predict media frames for your data.

  <ul style="font-size: 22px;">
    <li><b>Q: What is LDA topic modeling?</b>

    <li><b>Q: What do you mean by a "document"? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A document is a single unit of text - a standalone entity. Examples of documents include news articles, tweets, and paragraphs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: Is there a requirement for the minimum and maximum length of each document? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The size of a document can vary, but it has to be reasonably large. A typical document is about the size of a
          news article, a paragraph, or a tweet (~280 characters).  Single words or phrases will not yield a productive
          analysis. Longer documents (a corpus of books, for example) can be analyzed, but our system may take a very
          long time to handle the load.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What is the minimum and maximum number of documents I should upload? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is no absolute cutoff. Since LDA is an unsupervised method whose goal of "topic discovery" is relatively
          vague, the minimum number of documents, and the number of topics to use depends on your end goal. As a
          reference point, running LDA modeling on 50,000 general news headline datasets with 7-9 topics yields clearly
          distinct and recognizable topics that correspond to the typical news taxonomy(ie, war politics, sports, public
          safety, natural disasters, .. etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          The maximum number of examples is determined by the maximum upload size the server currently accepts, which is
          10MB. The longer each document, the smaller the total number of documents allowed. For example, 10MB is
          equivalent to about 250,000 news headlines.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What is a LDA "topic"? Is it equivalent to "frame"?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An LDA topic is not equivalent to a frame. Topics don't necessarily correspond to a way of talking about or
          understanding an issue; they might instead correspond to different events that are covered as part of the issue.
          We recommend you use the LDA topic modeling results to understand your data and help you decide what frames to
          be included in the analysis. Oftentimes, the LDA topic modeling analysis can help you discover potential issue-specific frames.

  <h3 id="bert-qs1"><strong>Build a BERT classifier to predict frames (Step 4-5)</strong></h3>
  <ul style="font-size: 22px;">
    <li><b>Q: What is BERT?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a Transformer-based machine learning
          technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. It is pre-trained on a
          large corpus of Wikipedia articles and books, and learns vector representations of words taking into account
          the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for "running" will have the
          same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences "He is running a company"
          and "He is running a marathon", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according
          to the sentence. The contextualized embeddings for a sentence can then be used as features for any text
          classification task. BERT itself can be fine-tuned on the target task so it learns embeddings that are useful
          for the task, for example for our news framing classification task.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What do you mean by a "document"?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A document is a single unit of text - a standalone entity. Examples of documents include news articles, tweets, and paragraphs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: Is there a requirement for the minimum and maximum length of each document? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The size of a document can vary, but it has to be reasonably large. A typical document is about the size of a
          news article, a paragraph, or a tweet (~280 characters).  Single words or phrases will not yield a productive
          analysis. Longer documents (a corpus of books, for example) can be analyzed, but by design BERT can only take
          at most 512 words as input. Generally, vector representation learning of longer texts remain an open research
          problem in NLP since language has long distance dependency but current models are still limited in the
          amount/length of context they can represent.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: How many labeled documents should I provide? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is not an easy question to answer as it depends on how hard the task is from a deep learning perspective,
          and how much performance is needed. The rule of thumb in deep learning is, the more the merrier. As a reference
          point however, you can keep in mind that on the Gun Violence Frames Corpus, using around 1300 documents,
          we obtain 82-84% accuracy to classify 9 frames.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What do you mean by a training and a testing set? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In supervised machine learning, we should evaluate the performance of the trained model before we decide to
          use it. To that end, we usually will divide all the labeled documents into a training set and a testing set.
          A training set is the dataset the model uses to learn the pattern it is supposed to understand. A testing set
          is the dataset that the model uses to figure out how well it has learned this pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let's say our goal is to predict the frames of a sample of 10,000 tweets. We will first draw a sample of 1000
          tweets and manually label them. Then we will divide the 1,000 labeled tweets into a training set of 800 tweets
          and a testing set of 200 tweets. We will train a BERT model based on learning the patterns of the 800 labeled
          tweets (the training set), and then use the model to predict the frames of the 200 labeled tweets (the testing
          set) as if the tweets were not labeled. Finally, we compare the predicted frames and the actual labeled frames
          so we will get an idea about the model performance. If the model performance is good, we will then use the
          model to predict the remaining unlabeled tweets (9,000).

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What is considered "good" model performance? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are no hard rules. In communication research, we usually aim for at least 80% prediction precision and
          80% prediction recall. In computer science research what is considered good model performance depends on the
          difficulty of the task. Generally, a model is considered good if it either outperforms or is comparable to
          previous state-of-the-art models on the same benchmark data with performance measures differing for different
          tasks and/or different benchmark datasets.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: What do I do if the model performance is not good? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>You can try a few things:
          <ul>
            <li>
              You should try to understand the "confusion matrix" first. For example, if you find the model always fails
              to distinguish between "unemployment" and "tax," you can consider combining them into the single category
              "economy."  Combining categories is helpful especially when you have a lot of categories; this makes
              labeling an easier task for the model.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also add more labeled examples. If the pattern you are trying to teach the model is complex
              (the labeling task involves a lot of subtleties like sarcasm, or the documents are short), then you
              can try adding more labeled examples.

  <h3 id="bert-qs2"><strong>BERT using the existing models</strong></h3>
  <ul style="font-size: 22px;">
    <li><b>Q: I have a dataset with news articles published during a specific date range. Can I use your model to generate frame labels? </b>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: I used one of the models to predict labels for my data, and I found the labels assigned to some documents do not make sense. Why does that happen? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Computers make mistakes, and sometimes a label that makes a lot of sense to a computer may not make sense to us.
          Also, our training data may not be as recent as the data you are doing inference on. If an issue has changed
          drastically in recent times, we may not have retrained our pretrained models to reflect that.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: I have a sample of labeled data that pertains to one of the topics. Should I use the existing models, or is it better to train a new model? </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That depends on your purposes. Try using the existing models first. Are the frames similar to the frames you're
          thinking about? Do the labels make sense for the work you are trying to do? If not, it may be necessary for you
          to label your own dataset and train a new model. Otherwise, it makes more sense to use the existing model.
          We usually consider 80% prediction accuracy and recall to be good performance. This means that around 20% of
          the documents' predictions will be incorrect. If your labeling accuracy is well below this threshold, you may
          want to generate your own model.
