## Installation Instructions

` npm install ` then `node express.js`

I have put express.js because it sets up a server for loading js files, incorporating it into the project, you need :

1. Datasets folder
2. Copy Stuff from index.html
3. demo.js is the main file, contains the entire logic for loading charts.

It has minimal design, so we will need to have some designing to do.
