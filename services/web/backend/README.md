# Notes
## Error messages
The API documentation below is missing what the API returns in case the user
provides incorrectly formatted input (or an incorrectly formatted file).

We're trying to be as RESTful an API as possible, so the *HTTP status codes*
*will be in the 4xx range if there was an error.* All the documentation below
pertains to when the *HTTP status code is 200*.

Regarding the body of the error messages, here is an example of an error
message when the user provides incorrectly formatted input to the `POST /classifiers`  endpoint.
(It will make more sense once you read through the documentation for the `POST /classifiers` endpoint)

The body of the request could have been:
```python
{
  "name": "Gun violence",
  "category_names": [
    "Economic consequences"
  ]
}
```

The HTTP status code is `400`. The body of the response is.
```python
{
    "message": "must be at least two categories."
}
```

## URL Prefix
You will have to prefix every endpoint with `/api/`.  If the server is
running on `http://localhost:5000`, the first endpoint below can be accessed by
doing `http://localhost:5000/api/classifiers/`,

# API Documentation

## List all classifiers.
This returns a list of the details about every classifier that is on the system.
